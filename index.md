# Intent

As a society we cannot seem to leave religion behind, we desperately cling to it
and drag its lifeless body with us forward through time. The religion as defined
within this repository seeks to be a suitable candidate for the doctrine to end
all doctrines. It leaves behind reckless hate, vestigial traditions, and 
arbitrary morals with the hopes of guiding people to science and a common,
neue-morality. This neue-morality exists only to serve the health of society, as
does law.

Furthermore, this religion is dynamic and shall not be frozen or branched. As we
progress in our pursuit of knowledge, we should update our values and traditions
to reflect the new and relinquish the old. There will be no versioning, only
current and non-current.
